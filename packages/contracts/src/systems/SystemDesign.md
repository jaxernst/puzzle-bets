Game creation:

- Game creation is minimal and simply creats a new 'entity' (id) and marks it as a Puzzle Bets game
- After creating the game, the game id can be fed through other systems to 'build' the rules of the game
  Rules and customizations:
  - Bet amount/currency
  - Max/min number of players that can join
  - Deadlines/submission timeframes
  - Solution verification methods

Open questions:

- Does it make sense to make sure that games set specific rules?
  - It seems the case that malofrmed or nosensical games could be created with with this, but maybe this doesn't matter?
